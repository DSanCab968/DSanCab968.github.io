            <h1>Goal 1: No Poverty</h1>
            <p>
                Goal 1 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions by 2030. 
                This includes ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status, have access to basic needs such as food, 
                clean water, education, healthcare, and adequate housing. Poverty remains one of the greatest challenges worldwide, affecting millions 
                of people and limiting their opportunities for a better future.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why Is This Goal Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Poverty is a multidimensional issue that goes beyond lack of income. It encompasses social exclusion, limited access to 
                essential services, vulnerability to economic shocks, and exposure to climate-related disasters. Achieving this goal means 
                creating policies that address economic growth, social protection, and equal opportunities for all.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Key Targets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Eradicate extreme poverty:</strong> Ensure that no one lives on less than $2.15 per day (World Bankâ€™s updated international poverty line).</li>
                <li><strong>Implement social protection systems:</strong> Develop national policies that provide financial and social support to vulnerable groups, 
                    including children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure equal access to resources:</strong> Promote fair access to essential resources such as land, technology, and financial services, 
                    allowing individuals to achieve financial independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Build resilience to disasters:</strong> Strengthen the ability of low-income communities to withstand and recover from economic, 
                    environmental, and social crises.</li>
                <li><strong>Support developing countries:</strong> Increase aid and investment to nations that struggle with poverty, ensuring they have the 
                    necessary infrastructure to create sustainable economic growth.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>How Can We Contribute?</h2>
            <p>
                Everyone can play a role in reducing poverty. Governments can implement policies that support income equality and 
                social protection. Businesses can provide fair wages and opportunities for economic growth. Individuals can contribute 
                by supporting charities, volunteering, or advocating for policies that promote economic and social inclusion.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Ending poverty is not just a moral imperative but also a critical step towards building a more just and sustainable world. 
                By working together, we can create a future where everyone has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their background or circumstances.
