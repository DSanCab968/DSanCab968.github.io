            <h1>Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</h1>
            <p>
                Goal 8 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, 
                full and productive employment, and decent work for all. Economic growth should be balanced with fair wages, safe working conditions, and 
                environmental sustainability.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Why Is This Goal Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Economic growth drives social progress, reduces poverty, and improves living standards. However, millions of people still work under 
                poor conditions, receive unfair wages, or face unemployment. Sustainable economic growth ensures that opportunities are available for 
                everyone while protecting workers' rights and the environment.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Key Targets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promote economic growth:</strong> Achieve at least 7% GDP growth per year in the least developed countries.</li>
                <li><strong>Create full and productive employment:</strong> Ensure that everyone, including young people and persons with disabilities, has access to decent jobs.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve labor rights:</strong> Protect workers' rights, eliminate forced labor, human trafficking, and child labor.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage entrepreneurship:</strong> Support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and promote innovation.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure equal pay for equal work:</strong> Close the gender pay gap and ensure fair wages for all workers.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote sustainable industries:</strong> Encourage businesses to adopt sustainable production and environmentally friendly practices.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>How Can We Contribute?</h2>
            <p>
                Governments must implement policies that promote job creation, protect workers' rights, and support sustainable industries. Businesses 
                should ensure ethical work environments, fair wages, and equal opportunities. Individuals can support companies that prioritize fair labor 
                practices, advocate for workers' rights, and continue to learn new skills to adapt to a changing job market.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Sustainable economic growth benefits everyone. By ensuring fair wages, equal opportunities, and safe working conditions, we can create 
                a thriving and inclusive global economy that works for all.
