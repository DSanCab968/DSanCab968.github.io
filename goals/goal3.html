            <img src="https://DSanCab968.github.io/assets/images/ods3.png" alt="Good Health and Well-Being" />
            <p>
                Goal 3 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages. 
                This includes reducing maternal and child mortality, ending epidemics, providing universal health coverage, and improving access to 
                essential medicines and vaccines. A healthier world means a more productive and sustainable future.
            </p>
            
        
            <h2>Why Is This Goal Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Health is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people around the world lack access to quality healthcare. Preventable diseases, 
                lack of sanitation, and limited healthcare infrastructure contribute to high mortality rates, particularly in low-income communities. 
                By investing in healthcare systems and promoting well-being, we can enhance life expectancy and quality of life.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Key Targets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reduce maternal and child mortality:</strong> Ensure that all mothers and newborns receive proper medical care and nutrition.</li>
                <li><strong>End epidemics:</strong> Eradicate diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure universal health coverage:</strong> Provide affordable healthcare services, including mental health and reproductive health.</li>
                <li><strong>Promote research and vaccine access:</strong> Strengthen global efforts to make essential medicines and vaccines available to all.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve environmental health:</strong> Reduce deaths and illnesses caused by pollution and hazardous chemicals.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>How Can We Contribute?</h2>
            <p>
                Governments must invest in healthcare systems, policies, and education. Businesses can support workplace health programs and fund 
                medical research. Individuals can contribute by practicing healthy lifestyles, getting vaccinated, and advocating for better healthcare 
                services. Volunteering in healthcare initiatives and donating to medical charities can also make a significant difference.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Health and well-being are the foundation of a prosperous society. By prioritizing medical advancements, universal healthcare, and disease 
                prevention, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live a long and healthy life.
