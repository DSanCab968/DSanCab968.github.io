            <h1>Goal 5: Gender Equality</h1>
            <p>
                Goal 5 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. 
                Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right but also a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Why Is This Goal Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Despite progress in recent decades, gender discrimination remains a global issue. Women and girls continue to face barriers in 
                education, employment, political participation, and access to resources. Gender-based violence, wage gaps, and harmful practices like 
                child marriage and female genital mutilation still affect millions. Achieving gender equality ensures that everyone has the same 
                opportunities to thrive and contribute to society.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Key Targets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>End all forms of discrimination:</strong> Eliminate laws, policies, and practices that disadvantage women and girls.</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminate gender-based violence:</strong> End exploitation, trafficking, and all forms of abuse against women and girls.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure equal opportunities for leadership:</strong> Promote women's full participation in political, economic, and public life.</li>
                <li><strong>Recognize and value unpaid care work:</strong> Promote shared responsibility for domestic work between men and women.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure universal access to reproductive health:</strong> Provide women with full rights to reproductive healthcare and family planning.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect women's rights to resources:</strong> Ensure equal rights to economic resources, land ownership, and financial services.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>How Can We Contribute?</h2>
            <p>
                Governments should implement policies that promote gender equality, close wage gaps, and protect womenâ€™s rights. Businesses can 
                ensure equal pay, create inclusive work environments, and support women in leadership roles. Individuals can advocate for gender 
                equality by supporting women-led initiatives, educating others about gender issues, and challenging harmful stereotypes in everyday life.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Gender equality benefits everyone. By empowering women and girls, we create a more just, innovative, and thriving society. 
                Together, we can build a world where all individuals, regardless of gender, have equal opportunities to succeed.
