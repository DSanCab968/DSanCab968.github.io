            <h1>Goal 2: Zero Hunger</h1>
            <p>
                Goal 2 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, 
                and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030. Millions of people worldwide suffer from malnutrition and food insecurity, 
                making this goal essential for achieving a healthier and more equitable world.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Why Is This Goal Important?</h2>
            <p>
                Hunger and malnutrition are among the biggest challenges facing humanity today. A lack of access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious 
                food leads to severe health problems, particularly among children, and can hinder economic and social development. Addressing this 
                issue requires improving food production, ensuring fair distribution, and supporting small-scale farmers to create resilient and 
                sustainable agricultural systems.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Key Targets:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>End hunger and ensure access to food:</strong> Provide all people, especially the poor and vulnerable, with access to safe, 
                    nutritious, and sufficient food throughout the year.</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminate all forms of malnutrition:</strong> Reduce stunting and wasting in children under five years of age and address 
                    the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant women, and older individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Increase agricultural productivity:</strong> Support small-scale farmers, promote sustainable food production systems, 
                    and improve agricultural research and technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Ensure sustainable food systems:</strong> Strengthen the resilience of food production to climate change, natural disasters, 
                    and other shocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintain genetic diversity in agriculture:</strong> Protect and promote the diversity of crops, livestock, and farmed animals 
                    to ensure long-term food security.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>How Can We Contribute?</h2>
            <p>
                Governments can implement policies that support sustainable agriculture and food distribution. Businesses can promote fair trade 
                and responsible sourcing of food products. Individuals can contribute by reducing food waste, supporting local farmers, and 
                advocating for food security initiatives. Small actions, such as choosing sustainable food options and donating to food banks, 
                can collectively make a significant impact.
            </p>
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Achieving zero hunger is not just about providing food; it's about creating a world where everyone has access to nutritious 
                meals and sustainable agricultural opportunities. By working together, we can ensure that no one goes to bed hungry and that 
                future generations have a secure and healthy food supply.
