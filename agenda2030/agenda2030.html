            <h2>Who Created Agenda 2030?</h2>

            <h2>The Aims of Agenda 2030</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of Agenda 2030 is to achieve sustainable development in three key dimensions: economic growth, social inclusion, and environmental protection. The agenda is based on five fundamental principles, also known as the "5 Ps":</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>People:</strong> End poverty and hunger, ensuring dignity and equality for all.</li>
                <li><strong>Planet:</strong> Protect the environment, combat climate change, and sustainably manage natural resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Prosperity:</strong> Ensure prosperous and fulfilling lives in harmony with nature.</li>
                <li><strong>Peace:</strong> Promote peaceful, just, and inclusive societies.</li>
                <li><strong>Partnerships:</strong> Mobilize global partnerships to achieve sustainable development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results and Progress of Agenda 2030</h2>
            <p>Since its adoption, Agenda 2030 has led to various initiatives and progress in multiple sectors. Some notable achievements include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Significant reductions in extreme poverty worldwide.</li>
                <li>Increased access to clean energy solutions and renewable sources.</li>
                <li>Greater global awareness and actions against climate change.</li>
                <li>Improvements in education access and gender equality.</li>
                <li>Efforts to combat plastic pollution and promote sustainable production.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, conflicts, and economic disparities have slowed progress in some areas. Continuous global cooperation is necessary to meet the 2030 targets.</p>
